Steps taken to complete this project. 
I downloaded the zips files which consisted of css, html, and js and opened them up in visual studio text editor. Since the HTML and CSS file was already writtedn out I proceeded to work on the js. I at first wrote my array with multiple strings, but realized thats not what the instructipns called for so i created objects within an array with a var = quote. The 2nd thing I procceeded to do was add quotes and sources to my opbjects. Then the function getrandomquote which creates a random number was written out. This part of the project is not fully my work I googled and found an example function that I used from treehouse
https://teamtreehouse.com/community/i-need-help-with-the-random-quote-generator-project. 
I then created a function that shows a new quote everytime the button is clicked and below that I used the following code snippet, along with the variable storing the string I assembled, to update my projectâ€™s HTML with a random quote:

document.getElementById('quote-box').innerHTML = yourStringHere; 

some of my quotes read undefined after the source, and i think it might be die to me only including citation and a year for two out of my 3  quotes. 

Sources i used for this project outside of treehouse consisted of
